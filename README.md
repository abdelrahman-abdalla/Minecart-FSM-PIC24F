# Minecart FSM – Embedded C on PIC24F

This project simulates a minecart control system using a finite state machine (FSM) written in Embedded C for a PIC24F microcontroller.

## Features
- Uses GPIO inputs to read button states and control LED outputs
- Implements hardware interrupts for system resets
- Integrates watchdog timer for timed state transitions
- Designed using nested switch-case logic in `main()`

## Technologies Used
- MPLAB X IDE
- PIC24F Microcontroller
- Embedded C

## Context
Built as part of an embedded systems course at Penn State. Demonstrates low-level control, timing logic, and real-time FSM operation on microcontroller hardware.
